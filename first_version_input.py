# Take UGRZ
# SFR OPTIC and UV 
# See what parameters of ilustris work
# Use 11 halos (Galaxy clusters) 
# SUB-HALOS = GALAXIES

# USE COLOR G - R AND MASS
#  CORRELATION MATRIXES
# 


# Luis and Paulina are going to work today on writing the code to take user input,
# and Jiani and I are going to work on getting the TNG data and processing it to a 
# form the model can use. If you want to work on any of that, let us know! Tomorrow 
# we can actually work on the ML model itself and on predicting the SFRs from the user photometry
